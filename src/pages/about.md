### What I Do

I'm a developer who loves breaking down complex problems into clean, automated solutions. Whether it's crafting **Discord bots**, experimenting with **AI-integrated tools**, or optimizing **full-stack web apps**, I'm always looking for the next thing to build.

* **Automation:** Turning repetitive tasks into one-click wonders.
* **Open Source:** Contributing to and creating tools for the community.
* **Learning:** Currently diving deeper into scalable architecture and AI models.
